# DESIGN-PATTERN

This project provides practical, easy-to-understand implementations of commonly used design patterns in Java. The patterns are organized into three main categories:

Creational Patterns â€” Focused on object creation mechanisms

Structural Patterns â€” Concerned with object composition and relationships

Behavioral Patterns â€” Deal with object interaction and communication

# Project Overview
This repository is ideal for students, developers, and software architects who want to learn, review, or reference classic design patterns implemented in Java with clear and well-commented code.

Each pattern includes:

A brief explanation of its purpose and typical use cases

A Java-based implementation

Example usage to demonstrate the pattern in action
